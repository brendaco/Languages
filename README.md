This Project Simulates a new Programming Language.

It is a language inspired by both Java and Python. 
These files are meant to be informational for those who want to try and write on the new code.

The "translator.py" files contains a translator that takes the new language's program and return the equivalent in Python code.
The "new_gram.txt" file contains the grammar for the language.
The "program.txt" file contains an example code of the file which is runnable on the translator.
The "error**.txt" files show errors that get called out by the translator if wrong syntax is used when writing in the new language.
